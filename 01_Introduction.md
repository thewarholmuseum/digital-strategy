# 1. Introduction

What does it mean to be a museum in the digital age? How can digital and emerging media help a cultural institution successfully meet its mission? Where does a museum begin on its path toward becoming truly optimized for the evolving digital landscape, and why is it important that museums do so?

The Andy Warhol Museum, like many of our sister institutions, is confronting questions like these with the museum's first formal digital strategy. This document is intended to be a roadmap as the museum works to infuse digital activities into its fabric. From in-gallery interactive projects to the digital literacy of Warhol staff (and all points in between), a structured strategy helps the museum stay focussed on priorities and goals, and it serves as a repository for progress along our journey.

### A Real-Time Document

The Warhol's digital strategy for 2015-2017 is a real-time document. This means it is living and evolving as we deploy tactics to meet the strategies contained herein. Each strategic thrust includes a *Strategy in Action* section, where we will make updates, additions and notes about ongoing activities.

By structuring our digital strategy as a living document, we have the freedom to respond quickly to external conditions, such as rapid shifts in technology and real-time digital metrics reporting. A transparent document such as this also keeps the museum publicly accountable for progress and momentum.

## 1.1 Vision Statement

The Andy Warhol Museum is the global keeper of Andy Warhol's legacy and through developing necessary resources it maintains that reputation. 

In order to realize this vision, the museum has identified the following strategic goals:

1. Make The Andy Warhol Museum reflective of Andy Warhol's legacy
2. Make The Andy Warhol Museum a must-see destination
3. Make The Andy Warhol Museum the premiere source of knowledge on Andy Warhol and disseminate that to the world
4. Guarantee financial stability for The Andy Warhol Museum
5. Maintain diversity as a core value of The Andy Warhol Museum

Each department in the museum is approaching its role and work with this vision statement and set of strategic goals in mind.

### More than a Museum

In addition to the vision outlined above, it is also important to bring attention to the museum's tagline: *More than a museum*. If a museum's core competency is to collect and preserve cultural artifacts, and share those artifacts with the world, The Warhol's mission is that and more.

Digital and emerging media are fundamental elements that help shape how The Warhol becomes *more than a museum*. Acknowledging the increasingly important role of digital activities within the museum, this strategy document is authored with that tagline in front-of-mind.

## 1.2 Strategic Thrusts

The Warhol has identified several areas of intense focus for digital and emerging media in the coming years. These areas of focus align with the museum's broader strategic goals and are designed to compliment them.

Strategic thrusts for 2015-2017 include:

* Experiences and Engagement
* Narratives and Access
* Organizational Adaptation
* Financial Solvency
