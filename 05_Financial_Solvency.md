# 5. Financial Solvency

Much like the way technology is transforming the way we live and work, it is also disrupting conventional business models. The cultural sector, in many ways, is shouldering the brunt of this disruption and struggling to adapt in the wake of small budgets and limited resources. The Andy Warhol Museum recognizes that, in order to maintain our status as the global gatekeeper of Andy Warhol's legacy, the museum requires adequate financial resources to fulfill its mission.

In concert with the museum's existing business model, we continue to investigate and harness digital technologies to help make a positive impact on the financial bottom line.

### 5.1 Philanthropy

Through integrated technology and thoughtful user experience design, The Warhol makes it easy for individual and corporate donors to financially support the museum. We elevate the culture of individual giving and utilize modern tools and methods to encourage philanthropic activity toward the museum.  

### 5.2 Earned income

The museum deploys technology to help increase earned income across The Warhol's business model. By integrating business verticals such as admissions, café, retail and events, museum leadership can rely on data to make informed, real-time business decisions.

### 5.3 Digital Flexibility

Technology cycles do not align with funding cycles. Often, when a museum has a concept for a great project, it doesn't have the funds or skill-sets immediately available to execute. The museum then seeks funding based on the project specifications. This can take months, sometimes years. By the time funding has been attained, technology has moved on. 

The museum works to systematically evolve from a digital project-based funding model to a digital operating-based funding model. This allows digital staff to be opportunistic with initiatives, in addition to making iteration and rapid development key elements to the museum's digital activities.

### 5.4 Strategy in action

The following are projects initiated or deployed between 2015 and 2017 that exemplify the Financial Solvency strategy outlined above:
