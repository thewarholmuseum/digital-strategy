#4. Organizational Adaptation

We are living and working in a time of digital transformation. Emerging platforms and technologies impact nearly all aspects of our day-to-day, and promise new levels of speed and efficiency. If the museum is to thrive in the digital age, it is important that all staff become comfortable and proficient with the new tools and workflows emerging technologies afford.

The world is evolving around us, so why should a museum stand in opposition to this transformation? The Andy Warhol Museum embraces this reality and works toward molding the organization into a museum that adapts quickly with technology and marches confidently into the digital future.

###4.1 Empowering a digital mindset

The museum works to empower staff to think critically and creatively about technology. With digital at the front of our minds, we can be creative and proactive with concepts and projects. We bring technology into project conversations early and create integrated experiences that marry digital and analog components in interesting ways.

###4.2 Developing internal skill-sets

The digital media department serves as an internal resource for staff and organizes learning opportunities intended to develop internal skill-sets with digital tools. The more comfortable staff becomes and the more successes we have with our digital toolbox, the more willing we are to continue our collective growth and knowledge base. 

###4.3 New organizational workflows

Digital activities should not be siloed into media or marketing departments, but instead woven into the fabric of the museum. Diffusing digital knowledge and skills throughout the organization makes room for the digital roles in media and marketing to focus on innovation at the leading edge of the digital sphere.

###4.4 Strategy In Action

The following are projects initiated or deployed between 2015 and 2017 that exemplify the Organizational Transformation strategy outlined above:

* Creation of the Mobile Experience Task Force - February 2015
* Creation of Media Production Task Force — July 2016
